This project is for tools to interact with TaskCard.

TaskCard is available at http://www.taskcardosx.com/

I'm not affiliated with TaskCard's developers in any way, 
just a happy customer who thinks I should be able to sync 
up my task list from TaskCard with TaskPaper
(so I can have my task list on my iPod Touch).
